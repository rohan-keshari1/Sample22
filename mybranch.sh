This script file is for the understanding of GIT Branching with Merge and Rebase
Author: RK

Now we have created the new brach called RK1 and switch to RK1 branch and updating this file.

Since we can use git cherry-pick commit id just for only only 2..3 commits to merge new branch updated with main branch, not for long commits
3. Here we have created new branch called mergeEg to practice merging of long commits from new branch to main branch
